# Week 1, Part 1: Parts of Computer

In this section, you will learn the basic parts of a computer. While there are more parts of the computer than we are presenting, we will only concern ourselves about the parts of the computer that you will very likely face on a daily basis.

For the purposes of the section and for the rest of the class, when we mean "computer", we are talking about Desktop and Laptop Computers (If you don't know what those terms mean, you will by the end of the section).

Again, we are only going to concern ourselves with Windows Computers, though most of the terms will transfer over if you are talking about Apple (Mac) Desktop and Laptops.

### The Monitor

A ***monitor*** is the "screen" of the computer. Monitors on a desktop looks like this:

On a laptop, it's usually the upper half of the computer. Basically, the monitor on both laptops and desktop is the part where you can see all the computer stuff.

### Mouse and Touchpad

A computer ***mouse*** is basically a device that tracks movement and sends those movements to the computer, usually to the ***cursor***. A cursor of the computer is the "arrow thing" on the computer.

Here's an example of a computer mouse:

Here's the typical cursor on the computer:

On laptops, the mouse is usually not included. A ***touchpad*** is used instead. Instead of physically moving a mouse to move the cursor, you would use your finger to rub against the touchpad to the direction of where you want to move the cursor.

Here's an example of a touchpad on a laptop:

### Keyboard

A ***keyboard*** is basically a device that lets you type things, usually text. On desktops, the keyboard is a separated while on laptops, it's tied to the laptop/

Here are examples of keyboard on desktop and laptop:

Typically there are two types of keyboard, mechanical and non-mechanical keyboard. The general rule is that if a keyboard makes a "click click click" sound, it's a mechanical keyboard. If the keyboard is silent while typing, it's a non-mechanical keyboard, usually the rubber or membrane keyboard.

In terms of functionally, they are the same though mechanical keyboards are more expensive usually. However, they do sound really nice and it is widely more preferred by gamers.

Typically a Desktop would have its own screen (Monitor), Keyboard and Mouse.
