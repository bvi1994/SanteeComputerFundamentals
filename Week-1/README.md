## Materials

I highly recommend that you always have access to a Computer, either using a Desktop or Laptop computer. **This course will mainly be taught using Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System. If you would like to know how to purchase a computer, see me as soon as possible. I can help recommend computers that will not cost too much as well that will last a long time.**

Computers (Windows 7) are available at the Santee Family Resource Center (1399 Santee Dr) from 8am-4pm.

## Course structure
You cannot gain the skills of using a computer just by watching presentations, you must actually use the computer.  Typically each session will have a 45 minute presentation of the overview of the topic followed by "hands-on" time. In addition, most courses will feature "homework" to reinforce and get more practice the computer skills that we went over through class.

## Rules of the course

Don't be a jerk. And don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Seriously, we are here to help. Oh, and don't be a jerk.

## Some words

No one is born knowing how to use computers effectively, it takes a lot of practice to gain the computer skills. It's really not easy. Even myself as a software engineer do occasionally struggle with personal computing. So don't feel bad if something doesn't "click." Remember, we all have to start somewhere. As long as you are asking for help and keep practicing those computer skills on a regular basis, you WILL eventually get it. I promise.
